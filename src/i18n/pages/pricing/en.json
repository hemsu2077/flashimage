         "description": "When your credits are depleted, subscription users (Monthly/Yearly) will receive fresh credits automatically at the beginning of each billing period. Pay As You Go customers need to purchase additional credit packs to continue generating images. You can upgrade to a subscription plan anytime for seamless credit renewals."
       },

         "title": "How long are my credits valid?",
         "description": "Credit validity varies by plan: Basic pack lasts 2 months, Standard pack is valid for 6 months, and Premium pack extends to 12 months. Subscription credits refresh on your billing cycle. To maximize value, make sure to use your credits within their validity period."
       },
       {
         "title": "How many images can I generate with my credits?",
         "description": "Each AI image generation typically consumes 2 credits. This means 100 credits (Basic pack) allows for 50 image creations, while 200 credits (Standard Monthly) enables 100 generations per month. Actual credit usage may differ depending on image complexity and generation parameters."
       },
       {
         "title": "Can I get a refund for unused credits?",
         "description": "Given the substantial computational costs involved in AI image generation, we're unable to provide refunds for purchased credits. That said, Pay As You Go credits come with generous validity periods, ensuring ample time for usage. Subscription users can cancel at any point to avoid future billing."
       },
       {
         "title": "What's the difference between the plans?",
         "description": "Pay As You Go provides flexible one-time purchases with varying credit quantities and expiration dates - ideal for sporadic usage. Monthly subscriptions deliver consistent credit refills plus commercial licensing and priority support. Annual plans include all monthly benefits while offering substantial discounts (up to 30% savings)."

         "title": "What types of images can I generate?",
         "description": "Our AI creates diverse image styles and formats based on your prompts and preferences. From photorealistic images to artistic interpretations, abstract designs to detailed illustrations - the possibilities are vast. You can specify style preferences, themes, and visual elements to achieve your desired creative output."
